			symbols & combinations formed by sensable geometric shaped contrasts are formed, copied, and interpreted as language to represent and/or define real things. computing processes use structured binary or other memories to encode data and operations to produce and handle symbols in their behavior with electrical logic gates. different symbols and 1-dimensional strings of symbols are given defined uses in programming languages or program codes. the transformations of substances of different forms take space and time to occur.

			<h1>Graphical Meaning:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>boundary ○ : can be a vertex/node/point and/or overlap others like a venn diagram.</li>
				<li>full boundary ●</li>
				<li>empty boundary ◌</li>
				<li>line - or ⎯ : difference between end points, like a distance between things</li>
				<li>segment ○⎯○ : extended to end points, like the length of some thing</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Some Speculative Holoscope Terms for the clearer symbols:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>● : presence ("in"). such as, some specific energy/matter/information contents/way of existing.</li>
				<li>○ : boundary. such as, some condition, circumscription, or context. can include, exclude, and overlap others.</li>
				<li>◌ : open ("out"). such as, some unknown or possibility. may represent an absence in or out of a boundary.</li>
				<li>⎯ : relation : (boundary ○ (⎯), relation ⎯, association ○⎯○)</li>
				<li>⇾ ⇽ : direction, step, change, ray, action, message, packet : (boundary ○ (⇾), (multivalued)function/operation ⇾, sequence ○⇾○)</li>
				<li>↔ : interaction : (condition/mode ○ (↔), reaction ↔, event ○↔○)</li>
				<li>⍖ : time: (moment/timing ○ (⍖), delay ⍖, duration ○⍖○)</li>
				<li>|⎯| : space: (location/surface ○ (|⎯|), displacement |⎯|, size ○|⎯|○)</li>
				<li>combinations of the lines types |⇽⍖⇾| and alternative/plural uses of the symbols are also possible.</li>
			</ul>
			these concepts might be more clearly understood with Feynman diagrams showing particle paths, Penrose diagrams showing time dilation, and/or diagrams of how computer memory states exist, interact, and change over space and time that conducting circuits can exist in.<br />

			all directly run turing-complete machine languages reduce down to sequential instructions that:
			<ul>
				<li>a⇽b : copy data between memory locations by reading/writing and potentially using reference/addressing signal systems.</li>
				<li>a⇽f(b) : can route data through transformation functions/operations formed by logic gates by sending and recieving with a separate circuit, or by writing to a stack of memory and to the program counter to redirect control to some other code.</li>
			</ul>
			basically, there exist variables in memory locations with particular states, taken out of a possibility space based upon the memory structure they're made out of, or something more specific due to what influenced it. a digital memory circuit storing a bit can store 1 or 0, but depending on what sets it, it might be only possibly 1, or only possibly 0.<br />

			the computing processes run in different threads with their own timelines that may sometimes interact, diverge, or converge. they can branch between different instructions out of sequential order by changing the data at the program counter / instruction pointer.<br />

			mathematical structures made from closed sets with operations that have inputs and outputs in a closed set form the basis of a huge majority of math and computer science. usually they are binary operations: operations with 2 inputs, but they can be 0, 1, or more than 2 inputs as well. these structures and their operations can be composed together to form composites.<br />

			data is stored in many forms and can get very complicated but large scale databases use relational tables identifying combinations of certain columns (primary keys) as unique identifiers for rows. those primary keys can then be referenced as foreign keys by other tables. one primary key is referenced by corresponding foreign keys in potentially many other tables.<br />
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Wiki: Class (computer programming)</a><br />
			object oriented programming involves the creation and use of classes to standardize runtime data into sets of fields (variable) and methods (function/operation) which are instantiated by specific objects 'of' that class. function code can be treated like a variable although usually is not. usually class methods are stored with the class and cannot be different for each object of that class. instead the methods are given different behavior based off of the changable field variables.<br />
			database tables line up with classes because each variable attached to objects of a class can be treated as a column of that class's table, and each row can be treated as a specific instantiated object of that class.

			being able to react to and potentially contradict one's own state introduces an instability in the ability to be predicted. this generally involves many things interacting, but it can be more specific like self-awareness.<br />
			<br />
			living systems are also fairly unique in their cycles of consumption, production, and reproduction of forms. living things are able to transform energy by consuming nutrients/energy sources and releasing waste.<br />

			the activities of living systems involve transformations of energy of different forms. this concept has been called entropy pumps. i think time flower is not a bad name too. for living systems, entropy might decrease locally, but the net change in entropy is still an increase. that is because they are open systems which are consuming energy from their surroundings.
			one way of viewing consciousness as part of life may be it as emerging out of the activity of biological or computational nervous systems inside living beings engaging in processes that effect/transform/influence/manipulate their surroundings and selves. as individuals living on earth, we participate in ownership-based processes that objectify living or unliving beings into commodities by their evaluation and the evaluation's context in exchanges and interactions. laborers are treated like resources for the production and continuation of profitable functional processes, work. then again, that depends on complex decisions involving sending and recieving, and there exist probabalistic and predictable functions and many different processes operating in apparently finite but connected environments. we experience certainty and uncertainty, avoidable and unavoidable dependencies, commodity circuits, and a tendency for the rate of profit to fall as the development of their commodity circuits approaches finite limits. consciousness seems to involve an internal subjective experience of thoughts, sensations, feelings, and emotions, which tend to lead us to make decisions about our actions/reactions/interactions with others. we share with, reflect, empathize with, conflict, contradict, confuse, and help each other. don't panic. be careful :)<br />
